Dixie Augusto! Thanks for taking interest in me, however you found me. Art/creation lives in limitation and negation. Like the Tao (道德经) says, it's the emptiness inside the vase that makes it useful. Music is no different my friend.

Claue DeBUSSY - "Music is the space between the notes."

How snooty of me to start off with such BIG-GIGGA-CHAD-BRAIN topics, but that's who I am. Likewise I'd like to take this moment to ask you to apply this to your life. What is it that you could remove from your life to make it better? Maybe you should get off this webpage and go kiss your mother. I'd bet she misses you.

Complication without depth is buffoonery. It's gae. Give space to what is truly essential. That is the sign of mastery. When your soul stands in front of the stars for review, what are the actions you want to call back on as your defining contribution. I just donated 6 LINK to charity! PUNK!

Sincerely, Dixie Augusto XOXO
